# Frontend Developer Test

####What URL should be used to access your application?
http://localhost:8888

As I have used Bower as the package manager for frontend dependencies. 
Before running the node server, please ensure Bower is installed and run bower install command inside public directory to install the front end dependencies.

####What libraries did you use to write your application?

angularJS and bootstrapJS

####What influenced the design of your user interface?

Tried to create a simple & self explainatory User Interface so that end user can access the required information in very less number of steps.


####What steps did you take to make your application user friendly?

Type ahead text box has been used to predict state abbrevations.
input validations has been used in login and Guestbook pages. 

####What steps did you take to insure your application was secure?

As of now nothing has been implemented to ensure the security.

####What could be done to the front end or back end to make it more secure?

1. User details/credentials has to be stroed in the encrypted form
2. We can use https calls to server in case of sensitive information


Thank you
